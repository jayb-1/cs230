            I’m a grinder when it comes to games I like whether it was FIFA, Fortnite or COD. 
            I always have an objective to keep me going, from building your team in FIFA bit by bit to doing challenges and events (good try Apex lol) in Fortnite to prestige in COD.
             This brings me to why Apex always feels like there’s something missing in that department, there’s no sense of real progression in anything. The game’s core mechanics and gameplay are so much fun, more than any of those other examples I mentioned. 
             When it comes to content or grinding towards something whether it be certain badges, skins, or anything really that you can earn through hard work or grinding, there isn’t really anything. It’s lackluster when it comes to content which is why I feel a lot of people stop playing it after a while. 
             I really wish it had more things to keep you playing apart from just the battlepass (which I’ve already completed too), this event for example could’ve been one but obviously failed. I end up getting on and playing a couple of games and stop playing because I just feel like I’m only going through the motions, with the only real objective to get the kill and win counter up.
              Even if they would do weekly updates like fortnite or even monthly, or a type of prestige system or more special hard to earn badges would go a long way to making the game feel ‘fresh’.

        I've been excited for this game ever since the Japanese release and I purposely avoided watching any gameplay footage so I could go in as blind as possible. It was well worth it because this game no doubt ended up living up to my expectations!
        Even though I love turn-based combat I wasn't sure if it would translate well to the Yakuza series because I had gotten so used to the beat em up style combat. Given that RGG Studio started fresh with a new protagonist and took the time to explain the 
        canonical reason for the new combat system it ended up fitting perfectly. They did an excellent job of preserving the spirit of past Yakuza games while still trying something new.
        The amount of things to do in Ijincho was excellent. Just like in all the past Yakuza games it had that feeling of finding something new to do around every corner of the city and it is significantly bigger than the places featured in past Yakuza games. My only complaint was 
        that there was a lack of side content in story mode.
        Despite the change in protagonists and combat this still a Yakuza game through and through. Just like previous entries it has a perfect balance of absolute ridiculousness in the sub stories/mini games and thrilling crime drama with emotional moments in the main story.

The amount of jobs was a little overwhelming but thankfully the game isn't too punishing when you decide to switch to a different one.

        DMC isn't an rpg...but there is an upgrade system. It's quite simple tho, basically you have locked movesets and upgrades which you unlock by spending Red Orbs (currency). The game is quite generous with these; so don't worry about any grind. There is no "tree" tho, you basically unlock everything by the end of the game.

The game is linear, so you there's not minimap since it's very hard to get lost...but DMC5 did go thru the trouble of implementing a waypoint system that shows you where you gotta go.

The game isn't complicated, so that is a plus for you...it does have a lot of gameplay depth tho. It's hard to say if you'll like it since you haven't played any "stylish action" game before; but if it's worth anything DMC5 is probably the best game of the genre so far.

If you're on console, i suggest you trying out the demo to get a feel of how the game is like. No demo for PC sadly, tho you could buy it on Steam and get a refund if you don't like it (just make sure you don't go over that 2h limit)
The maps are also mostly linear, so you don't need to worry about navigation very much. The objective is to fight through the level and face the level boss.   
Even though DMC5 is the most forgiving in the serie, If you are not use to them the DMC Can be hard, though the easy difficulty should be accessible for everyone i think.
